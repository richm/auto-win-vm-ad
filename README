Automatically create Windows Virtual Machines with Active Directory
and Certificate Services

This allows you to create a Windows VM complete with Active Directory
and Certificate Services, and Active Directory TLS/SSL enabled,
completely automated and unattended.

Currently only tested on (and hardcoded to work with) RHEL 6.3 with
kvm/qemu virtualization and Windows Server 2008 R2 Enterprise
Datacenter 64-bit.

Pre-Requisites
==============

These are the tools I've used so far:
* RHEL 6.3 64-bit with KVM/QEMU
** qemu-kvm - the basic virtualization packages
** python-virtinst - virt-install
** qemu-img
** libvirt-client - virsh
** dosfstools - mkfs.vfat
** openldap-clients - for testing the AD connection and getting the AD CA cert
** genisoimage - "extras" CD

* en_windows_server_2008_r2_standard_enterprise_datacenter_web_x64_dvd_x15-50365.iso
** an MSDN subscription is required for access to Windows ISO files
   and product keys
** I know 2008 R2 Enterprise Datacenter comes with Active Directory
   and Certificate Services
** Not sure what other versions contain these
** autounattend.xml, dcinstall.ini, adcertreq.inf, and the cmd scripts
   depend on this version

* KVM/Machine setup
** In order to easily keep track of the VM hostname/IP address I have
   done the following:
** edit /etc/hosts - assign an IP address and FQDN for the VM
   e.g. something like this:
 192.168.122.2 ad.test.example.com ad
** The FQDN must be the first one listed (just like for SSL/Kerberos
   testing)
** add your new vm/ip addr/mac address
*** virsh net-destroy default - virt network must be stopped first
*** virsh net-edit default - add a name, the IP address from above, and
    a unique MAC address to the <dhcp> section like this:
   <mac address='52:54:00:xx:xx:xx'/>
   <ip address='192.168.122.1' netmask='255.255.255.0'>
     <dhcp>
       <range start='192.168.122.128' end='192.168.122.254' />
       <host mac='54:52:00:xx:yy:zz' name='win2k8' ip='192.168.122.2' />
   That is, add a new <host ...> entry with a unique IP address and mac address
   The mac address must start with 54:52:00: and must be unique.
   The VM name (name='win2k8') does not have to match the hostname, but it must be
   the same as the VM_NAME parameter (see below)
*** virsh net-start default - start up virt network
*** virsh net-dumpxml default - verify that your new host entry is listed

You will need to provide at least the name of the VM to the script.
The script will attempt to find the FQDN, the IP address, and the MAC
address (or you can provide these).

Running
=======

ANS_FILE_DIR=/path/to/thisscript/answerfiles \
VM_NAME=nameofvm \
ADMINPASSWORD="your windows admin password" \
make-ad-vm.sh

There are many, many parameters you can pass as environment variables
VM_NAME - name of virtual machine
- default - ad
VM_IMG_DIR - path to your KVM/QEMU disk images
* default - /var/lib/libvirt/images
ANS_FILE_DIR - path to the config files and scripts used during Windows install/setup
* no default - you must provide this
WIN_VER_REL_ARCH - windows version, release, arch
* default - win2k8x8664
* must correspond to the WIN_ISO
WIN_ISO - the full path and file name of the Windows install ISO
* default - $VM_IMG_DIR/en_windows_server_2008_r2_standard_enterprise_datacenter_web_x64_dvd_x15-50365.iso
WIN_VM_DISKFILE - the full path and file name of the Windows VM disk image
* default - $VM_IMG_DIR/$VM_NAME.raw
VM_RAM - amount of RAM to use for VM, in MB
* default - 2048 (2GB)
VM_CPUS - number of CPUs to use for VM
* default - 2
VM_DISKSIZE - size of WIN_VM_DISKFILE in GB
* default - 16
ADMINNAME - user of Windows admin account
* default - Administrator
ADMINPASSWORD - password for ADMINNAME account
* no default - must be provided
VM_MAC - MAC address for VM
* default - will lookup from virsh net-dumpxml default for the VM name
VM_FQDN - fully qualified host and domain name for the VM
* default - will lookup from virsh net-dumpxml and getent hosts from the VM name
VM_CA_NAME - the name of the CA that will be created
* default - LMDN-LMHN-ca - where
** LMDN is the leftmost part of the domain name e.g. if your VM_FQDN is ad.test.example.com
** then the LMDN is "test"
** LMHN is the leftmost part of the FQDN e.g. if your VM_FQDN is ad.test.example.com
** then the LMHN is "ad"
** so the VM_CA_NAME would be test-ad-ca
VM_AD_DOMAIN - the domain of the AD server
* default - the part of VM_FQDN after the hostname part e.g. if VM_FQDN is ad.test.example.com
* the domain is test.example.com
VM_AD_SUFFIX - the AD root suffix
* default - derived from the VM_AD_DOMAIN - e.g. test.example.com -> dc=test,dc=example,dc=com
VM_NETBIOS_NAME - the NETBIOS domain name
* default - derived from VM_AD_DOMAIN e.g. test.example.com -> TESTEXAMPLECOM
ADMIN_DN - the full AD DN of the Windows Administrator
* default - cn=$ADMINNAME,cn=users,$VM_AD_SUFFIX

Windows
=======
Windows supports unattended install and setup.  In 2008 and some other
new-ish versions, this is done via a file called autounattend.xml.
When Windows boots off of the ISO, it looks for a file called
autounattend.xml in the root directory of all removable media.  We use
a virtual floppy drive (answerfloppy.vfd) as drive A:\ in Windows and
put the file there.

Setup goes through several different phases, or "passes" in Windows
parlance.  The last pass is oobeSystem.  It is during this pass that
we set the first of our "callback" scripts, postinstall.cmd.  We first
set Windows to AutoLogin the Administrator so that we can use the
FirstLogonCommands and later RunOnce commands, and tell it to
AutoLogin 999 times.  We use the FirstLogonCommands SynchronousCommand
to run the postinstall.cmd script.  This script uses dcpromo.exe to
setup Active Directory with our chosen domain.  It also activates
Windows with the specified product key.  At the end, it creates the
RunOnce script for the next setup pass (setuppass2.cmd), and tells
Windows to reboot in 2 minutes.  Active Directory requires a reboot in
order to complete the setup process.

During the setuppass2 pass at next login, we install and configure
Certificate Services in Standalone Root CA mode (setupca.vbs /IS),
then set the RunOnce to run setuppass3.cmd, and reboot again in 2
minutes.

During the setuppass3 pass at next login, we generate an AD server
cert request, submit it to the CA, sign it, and install it in the AD
cert repo, using certreq and certutil.  Once this is done, AD will
automatically configure itself to be a TLS/SSL server.

The different Windows files are:
PLATFORM.xml - e.g. win2k8x8664.xml - this is copied to the virtual floppy disk as the main
autounattend.xml file
postinstall.cmd - activate Windows with the specified product key, setup AD, setup pass2, reboot
setuppass2.cmd - install and setup Cert Services, setup pass3, reboot
setuppass3.cmd - request and install AD server cert
dcinstall.ini - unattended setup file for AD
adcertreq.inf - unattended AD cert request file
Setupca.vbs - Virtual Basic script that installs and sets up Cert Services
otherfiles - currently unused

Windows Troubleshooting
=======================
For general setup issues, look in c:\windows\panther\setup*.log

dcpromo - c:\dcinstall.log
setupca.vbs - c:\_setupca.log
postinstall - c:\postinstall.log
setuppass2 - c:\setuppass2.log
setuppass3 - c:\setuppass3.log
